# Project3
This Master Branch is used to update the currently finished Web Appliation. 
We should be able to merge this branch with development when development branch is in working state.
I tried using heroku's github automatic integration but this will not work with github enterpise.
Therefore, updating the working web app will have to be done through the cli.
